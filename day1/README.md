### 🧭 Objective

The goal of Day 1 was to gain practical experience with essential Linux terminal commands related to file management, directory operations, and basic permission handling.

### 📚 Commands Used

- File & folder creation: `touch`, `mkdir`
- File renaming: `mv`
- Permission settings: `chmod`
- Package information: `apt list --upgradable`
- Privileged execution: `sudo`

### ⚙️ Practical Tasks

- Created a text file: `a.txt`
- Created a folder: `backups/`
- Renamed a file from `b.txt` to `b_renamed.txt`
- Wrote a shell script: `day1_script.sh` to automate these tasks
- Checked system package updates using `apt list --upgradable`
- Saved upgradable package list to `upgrade_list.txt`

---

### 🛠️ Script

- [`day1_script.sh`](./day1_script.sh): Automates basic file and directory operations.
