# Day 5 ‚Äì SSH Key Authentication and Remote User Setup

### üß≠ Objective

The goal of Day 5 was to enhance remote access security by configuring SSH key-based authentication, creating a new user and accessing the system from a mobile device via Termux without a password prompt.

---

### üìö Commands Used

- User creation: `adduser`, `mkdir`, `chown`, `chmod`
- SSH key authentication: `ssh-keygen`, `authorized_keys`
- SSH connection: `ssh`, `cat`, `nano`
- User switching: `su - devops`
- File permissions: `chmod 700`, `chmod 600`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Tasks

- Created a new user named `devops` for secure remote login
- Set up SSH directory and permissions for `devops`
- Switched to the `devops` user using `su - devops`
- Generated SSH key pair on Termux (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`)
- Retrieved public key from Termux using `cat`
- Copied the public key into `/home/devops/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the Ubuntu system
- Verified that passwordless SSH login worked from Termux
- Wrote a shell script documenting the above steps
