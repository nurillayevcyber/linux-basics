# Day 4 ‚Äì User Management, UFW, and SSH Access

### üß≠ Objective

The goal of Day 4 was to learn how to create and manage local users, configure UFW firewall, enable SSH server, and access the system remotely from a mobile device using Termux.

---

### üìö Commands Used

- User management: `adduser`, `usermod`, `deluser`
- Firewall configuration: `ufw`
- SSH setup and usage: `openssh-server`, `ssh`, `hostname -I`, `ip a`
- User monitoring: `who`
- Termux SSH client: `pkg`, `ssh`
- Script editing: `nano`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Tasks

- Created a new local user and added it to the `sudo` group
- Deleted the created user using `deluser`
- Enabled UFW and allowed port 22 for SSH access
- Installed `openssh-server` and verified SSH service status
- Connected via SSH to `localhost`
- Retrieved the system's IP address using `ip a` and `hostname -I`
- Monitored logged-in users using the `who` command
- Connected to the same system from a mobile device via Termux using IP address
- Verified access using commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, and `uptime`
- Created a script file using `nano` editor
