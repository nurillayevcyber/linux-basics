# Day 2 ‚Äì Permissions, Editors, and Automation

### üß≠ Objective

The goal of Day 2 was to practice permission management using `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask`, as well as edit configuration files using `nano`, and automate tasks via a custom shell script.

### üìö Commands Used

- File creation & inspection: `touch`, `ls -l`
- Ownership and permission: `sudo chown`, `chmod`, `umask`
- File editing: `nano`
- Directory tree view: `tree`
- Script creation and execution: `bash`, `chmod +x`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Tasks

- Created a file `secret.txt` and inspected its permissions  
- Applied ownership changes with `sudo chown`  
- Updated file permissions using `chmod`  
- Configured default permission behavior using `umask`  
- Created and edited `config.txt` using `nano`  
- Installed and used `tree` to view directory structure  
- Wrote and executed `day2_script.sh` to automate key operations
